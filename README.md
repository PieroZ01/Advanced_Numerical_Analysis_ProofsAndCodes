## Repository Overview

This GitHub repository contains some theoretical proofs and the codes written for the **Advanced Numerical Analysis** course of the *Scientific and Data-Intensive Computing* master degree at Universit√† degli Studi di Trieste & SISSA (2023-2024)

Specifically, the `Advanced_Numerical_Analysis_proofs.pdf` file contains some proofs which were left as an exercise during the course, while the `Python_notebooks` folder contains the Jupyter notebooks with the codes written during the course, in which all the exercises were completed.
